# Hey, I'm Shaun

**Software engineer who builds things that work and helps others do the same. My 'fix', is often fixing your issue**

## About Me

19 years in the industry, mostly in private enterprise. I've maintained large scale global CDN infrastructure (100+ Tbps), built multiple high performing teams, survived corporate disasters, and helped build and launch globally impacting platforms that people take for granted today (video streaming, game downloads, object storage).

These days I spend as much time teaching as building. I believe the best engineers multiply themselves by lifting others up.

## What I Care About

- **Operational discipline** — Production systems deserve respect because they can impact real people
- **Eliminating toil** — If I do something twice, the third time a script does it.
- **Teaching over gatekeeping** — I'd rather spend hours getting someone unstuck than watch them struggle in silence.

## Current Focus

- Building internal tools that help teams understand complex systems
- Vibe coding — learning something new and sharing it with others 
- AI enablement — helping colleagues actually use these tools, not just talk about them

## Writing

📝 **[Comprehension Debt: The Hidden Cost of AI Speed](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7394756373919498240/)**  
_We might be entering an era where traditional "technical debt" becomes "comprehension debt" — code generated quickly that becomes a maintenance nightmare because no one truly understands how it works._

📝 Currently writing a fun novel of my own career with a little help from my AI friends

## Tech Hobbies

Python · Linux · Kubernetes · Docker · Grafana · Networking (BGP, DNS, CDN) · AI/LLM tooling (meaning everything now - unlocked potential )

## Hobbies

Handyman · Carpentry · Video Games

## Background

- Started in network operations, realized software was more interesting
- IT, network and CDN career — tech → engineer → supervisor → manager → director → return to IC work
- Helped build SRE practices before "SRE" was a job title everyone had
- Currently building tools and teaching people

## Philosophy

I have high standards that make some people uncomfortable. I'd rather build it right than build it fast, but I'm learning when "good enough" actually is.
